# snake-game-turtle

This is the code to the legendary snake game. I have used turtle module to develop an interactive UI based version of it. There are 4 components to code:
1. main.py(overall control)
2. snake.py(for snake body)
3. scoreboard.py(to maintain the scoreboard)
4. food.py(to automatically generate food)


Run this code with proper set up paths and enjoy some nostalgia.
